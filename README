This is simple program for limiting computer time.

For adding this program, in the prompt(Debian), type the following code:

$ g++ timeCutter.cpp -o timeCutter
$ sudo cp timeCutter /etc/init.d/timeCutter
$ sudo cp .timeCutter.conf /root/.timerCutter.conf
$ cd /etc/init.d/
$ sudo update-rc.d timeCutter defaults 90

Configuration file .timeCutter must contains time intervals in following format:
 hh:mm - hh:mm
In these time intervals computer can work. 
For example:
 6:00 - 9:00
 20:00 - 23:00
means that computer can work ONLY from 6am to 9am and from 8pm to 11pm. At at another time computer cann't work.
